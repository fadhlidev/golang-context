# GoLang Context Practice Repository

Welcome to my GoLang Context learning repository! This repository is dedicated to understanding and mastering the `context` package in the Go programming language. The `context` package provides a powerful tool for managing and propagating cancellation, timeouts, and values in your Go programs.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **Examples**: A directory containing practical code examples that demonstrate the usage of the `context` package for different scenarios.
- **Exercises**: A set of coding exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of the `context` package.
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to this repository if you're interested in collaborating.

## Getting Started

To get started with learning about the `context` package in Go, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fadhlidev/golang-context.git
```

## Running the Examples

All the examples here are written as test files. To run the examples, navigate to the relevant directory and execute the Go files using the `go test` command. For instance, if you want to run an example named `example.go`, use the following command:
```bash
go test example.go
```

Feel free to explore the examples, modify the code, and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of Goroutines.
